# Introduction

This is a sample post to demonstrate blog features. This post uses MDX to write content.

## Feature 1

MDX allows you to use React components in markdown:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ p: 2, bgcolor: 'primary.main', color: 'white' }}>This is a React component in MDX</Box>
```

## Feature 2

You can use regular markdown features:

- Lists
- **Bold**
- _Italic_
- [Link](https://example.com)

### Code blocks

```typescript
function hello() {
	console.log('Hello, world!');
}
```

## Conclusion

This is an example of how to write a blog with MDX and Next.js. You can add many other features such as:

1. Syntax highlighting
2. Custom components
3. Math equations
4. And much more...
